# QBCore

<Callout type="warning">
  QBCore support is experimental and cannot work as a "drag and drop" solution due to many incompatibilities.
</Callout>

## Compatibility

Ox Inventory provides a complete suite of tools to replace the built-in items and inventory system from QBCore, and is not intended to be used with resources designed around it.

- Stashes used by qb-inventory and its forks do not work, but can _possibly_ be converted.
- Remove `qb-inventory` (or similar), or qb-core will not function properly.
- Remove `qb-shops` and `qb-weapons`, as they depend on `qb-inventory` and conflict.
- Weapon holstering and draw animations (like in `qb-smallresources`) may break our own methods.

## Qbox Project

Qbox is a fork of QBCore being developed by a team of former contributors and developers on QBCore. The team is focused on improving performance and security, as well as converting resources to support our resources (mainly ox_lib and ox_inventory).

We _strongly_ advise using Qbox as an alternative to QBCore.

## Installation

- Setup [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework) or [qbox](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qb-core).
- Edit your `server.cfg`.
  - Add `setr inventory:framework "qb"` before starting your resources.
  - Start ox_inventory immediately after qb-core.

### Convert QBCore

If you have existing player data, you will need to convert it to a compatible format.

- Start the server and type `convertinventory qb` into the server console.
- Restart the server once conversion is complete.

## Optional Optimisation

All item related functions from Player, such as `Player.Functions.GetItemByName`, have been modified for compatibility purposes; however they are considered deprecated.

The reasoning is fairly simple - there's now additional function references and overhead to consider. Fortunately, the new Inventory functions can be used directly and offer a great deal of improvements over the old ones.

You should read through the functions section for further information, but the following should give you a decent idea.

<Tabs items={["QBCore", "Ox Inventory"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```lua
    local acetone = Player.Functions.GetItemByName('acetone')
    local antifreeze = Player.Functions.GetItemByName('antifreeze')
    local sudo = Player.Functions.GetItemByName('sudo')
    if acetone?.amount > 2 and antifreeze?.amount > 4 and sudo?.amount > 9 then
        Player.Functions.RemoveItem("acetone", 3)
        Player.Functions.RemoveItem("antifreeze", 5)
        Player.Functions.RemoveItem("sudo", 10)
    end
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Add the following code somewhere in your resource to cache the exports metatable.

    ```lua
    local ox_inventory = exports.ox_inventory
    ```

    You will be able to reference any functions exposed through the export.

    ```lua
    local items = ox_inventory:Search(source, 'count', {'acetone', 'antifreeze', 'sudo'})
    if items and items.acetone > 2 and items.antifreeze > 4 and items.sudo > 9 then
        ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'acetone', 3)
        ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'antifreeze', 5)
        ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'sudo', 10)
    end
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
