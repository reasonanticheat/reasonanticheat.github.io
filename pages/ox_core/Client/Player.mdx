# Client

When ox_core is imported into a resource it will create the `player` global.  
If `player` is nil, then the client has not yet selected a character and spawned.

**Example:**

```lua
print(json.encode(player, { indent = true }))
```

- player?: `table`
  - userId: `number`
  - charId: `number`
  - stateId: `string`
  - firstName: `string`
  - lastName: `string`
  - name: `string`
  - groups: `table`
